#1.	Get colours dataset â€“ has RGB and hex values - DONE
#2.	User enters image to check colours in Tkinter
#3.	Show image selected by user in OpenCV within Tkinter
#4.	At click by user show colour details
#5. Get click value - DONE
#6.	Determine right colour based on user selection by choosing between the smallest distance
